### Columns Used as Inputs in the Final Model
The following columns were used as inputs (features) in the final model:
- PatientAge  
- Diabetes  
- BloodPressureProblems  
- AnyTransplants  
- AnyChronicDiseases  
- PatientHeight  
- PatientWeight  
- KnownAllergies  

### Column(s) Used as Target(s) in the Final Model
- **Target Column:** HealthPremium  

### Type of Models
- **Multiple Regression Classifier**
  
### Software Used to Implement the Model
- **Software:** Python (with libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, seaborn & matplotlib)

### Version of the Modeling Software: 
- **'scikit-learn'**: '1.4.2',
- **'statsmodels'**: '0.14.2',
- **'matplotlib'**: '3.8.4',
- **'numpy'**: '1.26.4'

### Hyperparameters or Other Settings of the Model
The following hyperparameters were used for the 'logistic regression' model:
- **'fit_intercept'**: True,
- **'normalize'**: False,
- **'n_jobs'**: None,
- **'positive'**: False

## Quantitative Analysis
### Key Findings
- **Significant Variables**: Age, Transplants, Chronic Diseases, and Weight have the most significant impact on health premiums.
- **Insignificant Variables**: Blood Pressure Problems, Height, and Known Allergies showed no significant effect.
- **Model Performance**: The model achieved an R-squared value of 0.694, explaining 69.4% of the variance in premium costs.

## Conclusion
This analysis identifies critical health and demographic factors that impact health premium costs, providing insights for insurance premium modeling. While the model fits reasonably well, some variables remain statistically insignificant, highlighting areas for further refinement and exploration.
