# Multiple Regression Model for Health Premium Prediction

This repository contains a multiple regression analysis developed as part of the DNSC 6303 - Programming for Analytics I course at George Washington University. The project builds and evaluates a predictive model for health insurance premiums based on various health and demographic factors.

**Date:** September 2024  
**Model Version:** 1.0.0  
**License:** [MIT License](LICENSE)

## Intended Use
**Purpose:** 
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Build a multiple regression model.
- Analyze model diagnostics.
- Assess the impact of each variable on health premium costs.
- Provide insights and recommendations based on the results.
  
**Intended Users:** 
- Data scientists, machine learning enthusiasts, educators.
  
**Out-of-scope Uses:** 
- The model is not intended for production use in any critical applications or real-time decision-making systems.

## Objective


## Methodology
- **Architecture:** This model utilizes linear models such multiple regression classification tasks.
- **Training Data:** The dataset used for this analysis is [Payor](https://github.com/nmemranhussain/multiple-regression-python/blob/main/payor.csv), which includes anonymized patient data.
- **Model Details**: The multiple regression model predicts **health premium costs** (dependent variable) using the following independent variables: **Patient Age**, **Diabetes Diagnosis**, **Blood Pressure Problem**, **Transplant History**, **Chronic Disease Presence**, **Patient Weight**, **Patient Height**, **Known Allergies**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data was split into 80% training and 20% test datasets.
- **Model Fitting**: Using Python libraries to estimate model parameters.
- **Diagnostics**: Residual analysis and QQ plots for model validation.
- **Model Evaluation**: R-squared and residual distribution analysis to evaluate fit.

## Key Findings
- **Significant Variables**: Age, Transplants, Chronic Diseases, and Weight have the most significant impact on health premiums.
- **Insignificant Variables**: Blood Pressure Problems, Height, and Known Allergies showed no significant effect.
- **Model Performance**: The model achieved an R-squared value of 0.694, explaining 69.4% of the variance in premium costs.

## Conclusion
This analysis identifies critical health and demographic factors that impact health premium costs, providing insights for insurance premium modeling. While the model fits reasonably well, some variables remain statistically insignificant, highlighting areas for further refinement and exploration.
